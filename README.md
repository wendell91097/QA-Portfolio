Hello! 

Thanks for stopping by to check out my QA portfolio.

You can check it out here  --->  https://wendell91097.github.io/QA-Portfolio/

This is the basic setup for the site, with my bug report data being categorized as a JSON library and some Python to update the html with that whenever I have something new.
